<!-- TITLE: Text to Speech -->

Text to Speech (Short TTS) lets you broadcast a message to people in a channel. To do this, run the command `/tts <MESSAGE>` in the channel you want it to broadcast the message to. This always uses the system TTS engine, therefore sounds different across devices.

# Settings
You can select to receive TTS notifications and which ones to receive in your User Settings under Notifications > Text-To-Speech Notifications. There's the possibility to:

* Receive all TTS messages from all servers and channels you're in when /tts was run (Can get spammy, especially if you're a member of many servers that often use it).
* Receive TTS reading only for the channel you're currently focused on when /tts was run (Recommended)
* Disable TTS for every server and channel you're in, which is recommended if you just want text messaging without TTS in general.

TTS can also be disabled entirely in User Settings > Text & Images > Allow playback and usage of /tts command.
