# Subchannels
Subchannels are a feature of servers, allowing advanced channel organisation. Subchannels were first announced on December 15th, 2016, as part of the 2016 End of Year Teaser. They were fully released on September 21st, 2017. Both text channels and voice channels can be in the same category.

## Subchannel Usage
Subchannel categories can be made either with the right-click context menu, or the server settings drop down.

Just as voice channel names, subchannel category names support spaces and custom characters, such as default emotes. Subchannel categories also support their own permissions, but will only apply to inside channels if they are synced with the category.

The older "Text Channels" and "Voice Channels" are now made into categories on newer created servers, with older servers having no categories at all. The normal default channels (the two General channels) still exist in the same categories, however.
