<p>Purchasing this license will give you the ability to create announcement channels (although you can also make them in community servers), store channels and a store page along with giving you the ability to make your server public and server analytics.</p>
<h1>News Channels</h1>
<p>News Channels are like the announcement channels you make on your server these ones can be followed by users, the following system is like using a webhook but without hassling with anything but just clicking a button. A news channel may look like this.</p>

<h1>Store Channels</h1>
<p>Store Channels are channels you can see game details at, they're similar to store pages but they're contained inside your server on a channel, these channels have a naming structure similar to voice channels which allows uppercase characters and spaces in their names. A store channel may look like this.</p>
