# Features
Guilds may contain text channels, voice channels, roles and custom emojis.
## Text Channels
Text channels are how users communicate with each other on a guild. Each guild has a default text channel which cannot be deleted or changed so that only certain people may read it, however it can edited so that only certain people and/or roles may send messages in it. Guild administrators may create extra text channels. These extra text channels may edited so that only certain roles and/or users may read it. A guild must have at least 1 text channel (the default one).
## Voice Channels
Voice channels allow guild members to talk to each other using their voices. There is no default voice channels and all permissions may be edited for any voice channel. Guilds do not need to have voice channels.
## Roles
Guilds contain roles which - when assigned - give users certain permissions and a custom name-color (if set). Guilds typically use roles to assign special permissions or signify a rank on an external website.

## Custom Emoji
Each guild is allowed to upload 50 custom emoji, which can be used by any member (with the permission) on the guild. If a user has Nitro, they may use the guild's custom emoji on any other guild or private message that allows it. To upload custom emoji (if you have the 'Manage Emojis' permission) go to Server Settings and click the Emoji button. Once there, you will be promoted you may upload emoji and rename them. You may also delete emoji from this page. More information may be found at http://discordia.me/emoji.
# Verification Levels
Guild administrators may toggle the verification level. When a verification level is set, members must meet the criteria before they can create a direct message with someone in the guild or send messages in a text channel. If a member is assigned a role, they will bypass the verification.

Levels:
* None
* Low - Must have a verified email.
* Medium - Must also be registered on Discord for longer than 5 minutes.
* (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ - Must also be on the server for 10 minutes.

# Vanity URLs
Some servers have custom invite URLs containing words instead of randomly generated numbers and letters. One example of this is http://discord.gg/discord-developers, which links to the Discord Developers server. Servers typically get vanity URLs if they are a Discord Partner. Only Discord Developers can create Vanity URLs.
