<!-- TITLE: Emojis -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A picture is worth a thousand words, so why not have your very own emojis? Thankfully, Discord includes a quick and easy way to add pretty much any image as a custom emote! (That is, as long as you have the "Manage Emojis" permission) -->

## Custom Emoji

## **Here's how it works:**
First, navigate yourself to the nice little [Server Settings](/server-settings) box at the top of the screen and click on it

![Adacbd](/uploads/adacbd.gif "Adacbd")

This'll bring up a screen with several options, of which we will choose the one marked "Emoji"

![455 Dac](/uploads/455-dac.gif "455 Dac")

Now, you'll be able to pick any image and upload it!

> NOTE: There ***is*** a small catch in which any images you upload will be downscaled to 32x32px, but that's just meager stuff, right?

Whenever you finish making your new emote, you can edit the emoji's name by clicking on the name, then changing it according to how you feel is appropriate.

* All emoji names *are* case-sensitive, meaning that :discord: is different than :Discord:
* If there are two emojis of the same name, such as having two :discord: emotes that are all lowercase, Discord will create a ~number behind it to make :discord~1:, :discord~2:, etc
* At the current time of publication, servers are only allowed to have 50 custom emojis unless the others are BTTV or Subscribe emotes.

## Animated Emoji

Animated emojis were added on December 21st, 2017 for Nitro users only. These emojis can be added normally, without Nitro, to servers, but only able to be used by Nitro users. Animated emojis will pause on the first frame if posted by webhooks, or if the Discord window is out of focus. These emojis will still play if posted by bots, as bot accounts have Nitro. These emojis also do not add to the total emoji cap, and instead have their own cap of 50 animated emojis.

## Other Emoji
There *are* a few other kinds of emotes for your discord use and enjoyment; Gamewisp and Subscriber emotes.

These are the only two kinds of emotes you can use globally without [**Discord Nitro**](/nitro). (Click the link for more information)

## Subscriber Emoji

This one is not as easy to get, these would be 5 emotes that **only** your twitch subscribers can get. This means you need to be a Twitch Partner and have to connect your twitch to your discord server (under integrations)

Have fun, stay safe, and keep it happening! May your memes be more than dreams.
