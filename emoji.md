## Custom Emoji
### A picture is worth a thousand words, so why not have your very own emojis? Thankfully, Discord includes a quick and easy way to add pretty much any image as a custom emote! (That is, as long as you have the "Manage Emojis" permission)

 __Here's how it works:__
First, navigate yourself to the nice little server settings box at the top of the screen and click on it

This'll bring up a screen with several options, of which we will choose the one marked "Emoji"

Now, you'll be able to pick any image and upload it! 
> NOTE: There ***is*** a small catch in which any images you upload will be downscaled to 32x32px, but that's just meager stuff, right?

Whenever you finish making your new emote, you can edit the emoji's name by clicking on the name, then changing it according to how you feel is appropriate :3
> All emoji names *are* case-sensitive, meaning that :discord: is different than :Discord:
> 
> If there are two emojis of the same name, such as having two :discord: emotes that are all lowercase, Discord will create a ~number behind it to make :discord~1:, :discord~2:, etc


> At the current time of publication, servers are only allowed to have 50 custom emojis.

Have fun, stay safe, and keep it happening! Quick final note, in order to use your brand spanking new emoji on other servers, you have to have this cool thing called Discord Nitro, which we'll get into in another article!
