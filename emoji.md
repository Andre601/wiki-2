<!-- TITLE: Emojis -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A picture is worth a thousand words, so why not have your very own emojis? Thankfully, Discord includes a quick and easy way to add pretty much any image as a custom emote! (That is, as long as you have the "Manage Emojis" permission) -->

## Custom Emoji

#### __Here's how it works:__
First, navigate yourself to the nice little Server Settings box at the top of the screen and click on it

![Server Settings](https://imgur.com/pRNsJv4.png)

This'll bring up a screen with several options, of which we will choose the one marked "Emoji"

Now, you'll be able to pick any image and upload it! 
> NOTE: There ***is*** a small catch in which any images you upload will be downscaled to 32x32px, but that's just meager stuff, right?

Whenever you finish making your new emote, you can edit the emoji's name by clicking on the name, then changing it according to how you feel is appropriate :3
> All emoji names *are* case-sensitive, meaning that :discord: is different than :Discord:
> 
> If there are two emojis of the same name, such as having two :discord: emotes that are all lowercase, Discord will create a ~number behind it to make :discord~1:, :discord~2:, etc

> At the current time of publication, servers are only allowed to have 50 custom emojis unless the others are BTTV or Subscribe emotes.

## Other Emoji
There *are* a few other kinds of emotes for your discord use and enjoyment; BetterTTV and Subscriber emotes.

These are the only two kinds of emotes you can use globally without [**Discord Nitro**](https://discordia.me/nitro). (Click the link for more information)

#### __BetterTTV__

Better TTV is a Twitch service that provides Twitch channel emotes, and global discord emotes. (Assuming you connect your account to Discord) Users need to meet certain requirements in order to use this;
* Twitch partner.
* Have over 1,000 Twitch followers.
* Stream at least 3 times a week on Twitch with at least 15 viewers.
If you feel you meet these requirements and want your server to have global emotes for everyone, go to [this page](https://manage.betterttv.net/)

#### __Subscriber Emoji__

This one is not as easy to get, these would be 5 emotes that **only** your twitch subscribers can get. This means you need to be a Twitch Partner and have to connect your twitch to your discord server (under integrations)

Have fun, stay safe, and keep it happening! May your memes be more than dreams.
