<!-- TITLE: Emojis -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A picture is worth a thousand words, so why not have your very own emojis? Thankfully, Discord includes a quick and easy way to add pretty much any image as a custom emote! (That is, as long as you have the "Manage Emojis" permission) -->

## Custom Emoji

## **Here's how it works:**
First, navigate yourself to the nice little [Server Settings](/server-settings) box at the top of the screen and click on it

![Accessing Server Settings](/uploads/server-settings/accessing-server-settings.gif "Accessing Server Settings")

This'll bring up a screen with several options, of which we will choose the one marked "Emoji"

![Emoji Button](/uploads/emoji/emoji-button.gif "Emoji Button")

Now, you'll be able to pick any image and upload it!

> NOTE: Any images you upload as emotes will be downscaled to 128x128px.

Whenever you finish making your new emote, you can edit the emoji's name by clicking on the name, then changing it according to how you feel is appropriate.

* All emoji names *are* case-sensitive, meaning that :discord: is different than :Discord:
* If there are two emojis of the same name, such as having two :discord: emotes that are all lowercase, Discord will create a ~number behind it to make :discord~1:, :discord~2:, etc
* Servers can have 50 regular and 50 animated emojis, each having their own cap.

## Animated Emoji

Animated emojis were added on December 21st, 2017 for use by Nitro users only. These emojis can be added normally, without Nitro, to servers, but only able to be used by Nitro users. Animated emojis will pause on the first frame if posted by webhooks, or if the Discord window is out of focus. As bot accounts technically have Nitro, they can use animated emojis. These emojis also do not add to the total emoji cap, and instead have their own cap of 50 animated emojis.

## Other Emoji
There *are* a few other kinds of emotes for your discord use and enjoyment; Gamewisp and Subscriber emotes.

These are the only two kinds of emotes you can use globally without [**Discord Nitro**](/nitro).

## Subscriber Emoji

This one is not as easy to get, these would be 5 emotes that **only** your twitch subscribers can get. This means you need to be a Twitch Partner and have to connect your Twitch account to your Discord server (under integrations).
