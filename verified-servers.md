# Summary
Verified servers were announced on October 12, 2017, and introduced with the Minecraft, PUBG, Supercell, and Offworld servers. Unlike normal servers which are run by normal members, verified servers are run by game publishers and/or developers. Along with being run by official members of the community, they also have different requirements, such as Medium verification level, and enabled Explicit Content Filter. These servers also get Partner server perks, such as custom discord.gg links and invite backgrounds. One exclusive perk is Verified badges.

# Verified Badge
Verified badges are shown both near the server name and in the web invite module. Verified badges are unlike profile badges, and are only on servers and not users.

## Old Verified Badges
Older Verified badges only existed for a very limited period, and were only on Discord-official servers, such as Discord Developers.
