Server Templates looks similar to a gift or a server invite when you receive them, but how it acts when you click on them is very different, it will prompt you to a flow like a server creation flow.

Here you can select a server name and icon for the new "cloned" server.

## Templates will copy
- Channels and channel topics
- Roles and permissions
- Default server settings

## Templates will not copy
- Messages or any content
- Members or bots
- Your server icon, Boosts, or any other perks

When you send a Server Template link you can see how many times the template has been used and the name that the template creator gave the template.


## Notices
* You need to have the Manage Server permission.
* The endpoint cannot be used by bots, even if they have the permission.
