Server Templates looks similar to a gift or a server invite when you receive them, but how it acts when you click on them is very different, it will prompt you to a flow like a server creation flow.

Here you can select a server name and icon for the new "cloned" server.

# Templates Will Copy
- Channels and channel topics
- Roles and permissions
- Default server settings

# Templates Will Not Copy
- Messages or any content
- Members or bots
- Your server icon, Boosts, or any other perks

When you receive a Server Template you will see how many people has used the template and the name that the template creator gave the template.
