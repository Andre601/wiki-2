Discord's Developer Application License (commonly known as the **gamedev license**) is a license that you need to buy if you want to publish your game on Discord.

On the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) you will see a prompt talking about the license on the left bottom corner. *Your app should be on a team to get a license.*

Purchasing this license will give you the ability to create announcement channels (although you can also make them in community servers), store channels and a store page along with giving you the ability to make your server public and server analytics.

# News Channels
News Channels allow you publish (also known as "crossposting") messages to any other server that follows this particular server.  
You publish a message by clicking the "publish" icon next to the message (The megaphone icon). *This requires you to either be the author of the message or to have Manage Message Perms!*

# Store Channels
Store Channels are channels you can see game details at, they're similar to store pages but they're contained inside your server on a channel, these channels have a naming structure similar to voice channels which allows uppercase characters and spaces in their names. A store channel may look like this.

But this is not all, when you get this license you get access plenty of choices about your game, ability to create gift links, ability to create and modify your store channel and plenty more.
