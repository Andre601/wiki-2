An Easter Egg is an undocumented/secret feature in a piece of computer software that is usually included as a joke or for fun.

The following is a list of discovered easter eggs on Discord. 

Found an easter egg that isn't on this list? Let a Wiki Editor know! 

# Discord Homepage
On Discord's website [homepage](https://discordapp.com) there are many objects that, when clicked, cause a small object (usually Mario related) to appear on the screen.

One example of the clickable objects is the [question box](http://cdn.discordia-dev.com/5rFxPo2E.png "Question Box") towards the top of the page.
There is also a small chance that a Wumpus (the mascot of Discord) will appear from that question box, instead of a Mario related item.

# Remixed Ringtone
Users have a 0.1% chance upon startup of Discord that they will receive a remixed version of the incoming call ringtone during either a group or two-person voice call. If a user receives the remixed ringtone, it will play for the whole duration of the call instead of ending when the user joins the call. According to Discord staff, this is the rarest easter egg. You may hear the remixed ringtone [here](https://canary.discordapp.com/assets/b9411af07f154a6fef543e7e442e4da9.mp3).

# Rate Limits Documentation Page
On the [Discord API Rate Limits documentation page](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits) there is a [colon](http://cdn.discordia-dev.com/xaSYoLyK.png) that when clicked opens [this website](http://takeb1nzyto.space). The website is a fun animation created by [Dougley](http://dougleyownsthisdomain.takeb1nzyto.space/). This easter egg was implemented by Night, a Discord staff member.

# Empathy Banana
When your [search](/search) leads to no results, Discord will sometimes display an "empathy banana" instead of the usual no results dialogue. This is completely random.

# Computer Man
Visiting [printer.discordapp.com](https://printer.discordapp.com) will redirect you to a [video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeg_TJvkSjg) from an old Canadian show called Vid Kids. [b1nzy](https://twitter.com/b1naryth1ef), a Discord Developer was the one to implement this easter-egg. 

# Snek Game
When you try to access a page that doesn't exist such as [this one](https://discordapp.com/TheDiscordWikisPartnership) you are redirected to a 404 page. Clicking the button on the console next to Nelly the Robo-Hamster starts a game like the classic Snake Game. Discord developer [tcoil](https://twitter.com/t_coil) made this game.

# "Discodo" sound
Clicking very consistantly on the "Home" icon in the Discord client will enable a "Discodo" sound effect which will be played each time the client is reloaded.
You can disable it by clicking the icon again, very consistantly, which will play the voice channel disconnect sound confirming the change.

The "Discodo" sound comes from the [update video about the improved white theme](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BJHZxqyfrqk?t=61).

You may hear the sound [here](https://canary.discordapp.com/assets/773745b4ebae9f47e802724ec33b8a3f.mp3).

# Name copying
If you click your name in the corner, it will show "Copied!". If you click it more, though, it says different things. Here's a progressive list.

# Boosting confetti
Hovering over the boost icon on a boost message will cause confetti to appear. This is not possible in the mobile app.

Hovering over the boost icon also has a small chance for an animated Wumpus to appear in any of the four corners of the chat window at random and throw out more confetti.

# Softsoap
Softsoap is a brand of soap, most primarily in the forms of hand soap and body wash, that was first created in 1980 by Robert R. Taylor, before being sold to the Colgate company seven years later.  Softsoap is often found in Discord's Game Night streams, though it also occasionally cameos in "new feature" videos. (for example, a bottle of *Pomegranate and Mango Infusions* Softsoap can be found in the background of [Discord's Nitro Brew Coffee April Fools video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z4GW6Vd6NI))  The two most referenced bottles of Softsoap are *"Pomegranate and Mango Infusions Bodywash"* in 18 fl oz. quantity and *"Lavender & Chamomile Hand Soap"* in 7.5 fl oz quantity.

The inside joke's debut was in the October 2016 Game Night stream, in which former Discord staff member Zencha frequently transitions his sentences into advertisements for *Pomegranate and Mango Infusions* Softsoap, claiming that it will give the customer "silky smooth skin".
