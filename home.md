# Welcome
## About us

We're The Discord Wiki. We're proud to be one of the leading providers of information about Discord to date, and we welcome you to our site! We started a server about a year ago after realizing that our resources could be used to help others learn about Discord instead of taking all of the tasty information bits for ourselves! A year later, we succeed in providing at least some sort of info to over 3.5 million users a month! We're ever expanding our information, so if you feel like you have the passion, the will, and the resolve required to write articles for us, check out the FAQs channel in our server and sign up to help contribute!
