<!-- TITLE: Bots -->

Discord allows users to create Bots and invite them to servers. Discord has created a unique API that allows users to create applications that interact directly with the server. You can view the API documentation [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro).

There is a community driven Discord API server that may be accessed [here](http://discord.gg/discord-api).
# Server Bots
Most type of bots are server bots. Server bots have dedicated bot accounts that are different from user accounts and function mainly on servers and sometimes in direct messages. There are hundreds of server bots on Discord that have different functions. To invite a server bot to your guild, you need to authorize it with an authorization link specific to that bot. To invite a bot, click the authorization link, select a server, deny or allow it to have the permissions listed on the page and click 'Invite'. To remove a bot from your server, simply kick or ban it like you would any other user. Bot accounts have a bot tag next to their name. If you want to create your own server bot, you need to register it through Discord's appliation page. Click [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) to access the applications page.
# Selfbots
Selfbots are when a user uses the Discord API to adhance their account and give them some automated abilities, such as a self ping and embeds. A self bot runs on your account (not through the applications page) and has the ability to post messages for you. While Selfbots are allowed, they are not reccomended and can result in punishment if they are abused. Your selfbot must only respond to commands from you, otherwise it is a userbot which is not allowed. To use a selfbot, you need your user token which can be found on the console. **Do not give anyone your user token. If someone gets your user token, they can do serious damange to your account, including reading messages, sending messages and mess with any server you have permissions on.**
# Userbots
Usersbots are fully functioning bots run through a regular account. This is against the Discord Terms of Service. If you encounter a userbot, please report it to support@discordapp.com.
