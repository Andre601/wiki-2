<!-- SUBTITLE: The Terms of Service for any services provided by Discordia -->

# 1. Acceptance of the Terms of Service
Welcome to **Discordia** (a.k.a. "**we**" or "**us**" or the "**Company**"). We are excited to have you as user and member of the community. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "**Terms of Service**") apply to your use of https://discordia.me, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via https://discordia.me (the "**Services**"). The Terms of Service also include our **Privacy Policy**, which you can review [HERE](https://discordia.me/privacy)


We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using us, because **by using the Services you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service.**

**SHOULD YOU DISAGREE WITH ANY OF THE PROVISIONS HEREIN, YOU CAN EITHER LEAVE THE SERVICES, OR CONTACT US AT SUPPORT@THEDRUTRIBE.US.**

# 2. Changes to the Terms of Service and the Services
Discordia is a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near future. We reserve the right to update the Services as well as these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion. We will make sure to announce any major change in a prominent way, but since "major" is a very subjective concept, you can always feel free to return to this page at any time. **Your continued use of the Services following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree with any changes.**

# 3. Accessing the Website, Security and Privacy
We are working hard on improving Discordia, but we cannot guarantee that the Services will be up and running 24/7. We also reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Services are unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss (see also Section 7 below).

To access certain features of the Services, you have to register by entering your email and choosing a password as part of our security procedures. You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using Discordia in person. There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password, but please notify us of any breach of security. We highly recommend to choose a strong password and that you log out from your account at the end of every session.

It is a condition of your use of the Services that all the information you provide on the Services is correct, current and complete. In the future, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. As custom for internet websites, we reserve the right to disable any user account, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Service.

We use SSL encrypted browsing, but we cannot guarantee that all use will be secure. We also do not guarantee that the Website or any content provided on the Website is error free. We manage your personal data according to our **Privacy Policy.**
