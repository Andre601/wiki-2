An Easter Egg is an undocumented/secret feature in a piece of computer software that is usually included as a joke or for fun.

The following is a list of discovered easter eggs on Discord. 

Found an easter egg that isn't on this list? Let a Wiki Editor know! 

# Discord Homepage
On Discord's website [homepage](https://discordapp.com) there are many objects that when clicked cause a small object (usually Mario related) to appear on the screen.

One example of the clickable objects is the question-box towards the top of the page.
There is also a small chance that a wumpus (The mascot of Discord) will appear from that question-box, instead of a Mario related item.

# Remixed Ringtone
Users have a 0.1% chance upon startup of Discord that they will receive a remixed version of the incoming call ringtone during either a group or two-person voice call. If a user receives the remixed ringtone, it will play for the whole duration of the call instead of ending when the user joins the call. According to Discord staff, this is the rarest easter egg. You may hear the remixed ringtone [here](https://canary.discordapp.com/assets/b9411af07f154a6fef543e7e442e4da9.mp3).

# Secret Keyboard Combo
From the Keyboard Combinations menu you may enter a secret command that plays an animation based on the [Shun Goku Satsu](
http://streetfighter.wikia.com/wiki/Shun_Goku_Satsu) attack from Street Fighter games.

To view this easter egg first pull up the Keyboard Combo menu by typing 'Control /' on a Windows computer or 'Command /' on a Macintosh. This can't be done via the Discord mobile apps. 

Once on the Keyboard Combo menu, type the command 'hh [right arrow] nk'. Typing this command will display the animation on your screen. You may view the animation [here](http://i.imgur.com/yV4M1jh.gif).

> This easter egg was publicized during the TAYNE update

# Rate Limits Documentation Page
On the [Discord API Rate Limits documentation page](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits) there is a [colon](http://i.imgur.com/BkLamTK.png) that when clicked opens [this website](http://takeb1nzyto.space). The website is a fun animation created by [Dougley](http://dougleyownsthisdomain.takeb1nzyto.space/). This easter egg was implemented by Night, a Discord staff member.

# Miguel's Fedora
On the Discord [Jobs Page](https://discordapp.com/jobs) you can click on the different staff member's heads. When you click on a head, an object (such as a pokeball) will fall on it. If you click on Miguel Gaeta's head, one of the objects that might fall is a blurple fedora (amount of clicks until the fedora appears varies).

# Empathy Banana
When your [search](/search) leads to no results, Discord will sometimes display an "empathy banana" instead of the usual no results dialogue. This is completely random.

# Computer Man
Visiting [printer.discordapp.com](https://printer.discordapp.com) will redirect you to a [video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeg_TJvkSjg) from an old Canadian show called Vid Kids. [b1nzy](https://twitter.com/b1naryth1ef), a Discord Developer was the one to implement this easter-egg. 

# Snek Game
When you try to access a page that doesn't exist such as [this one](https://discordapp.com/TheDiscordWikisPartnership) you are redirected to a 404 page. Clicking the button on the console next to Nelly the Robo-Hamster starts a game like the classic Snake Game. Discord developer [tcoil](https://twitter.com/t_coil) made this game.

# "Discodo" sound
When you double-click twice on the "Home" icon in the Discord client, will you enable a "Discodo" sound effect which will be played each time you reload it.
You can disable it by double-clicking the icon twice again.

The "Discodo" sound comes from the [update video about the improved white theme](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BJHZxqyfrqk?t=61).

You may hear the sound [here](https://canary.discordapp.com/assets/773745b4ebae9f47e802724ec33b8a3f.mp3).

# Name copying
If you click your name in the corner, it will show "Copied!". If you click it more, though, it says different things. Here's a progressive list.

> "Copied!"
{.is-success}

> "Double Copy!"
{.is-success}

> "Triple Copy!"
{.is-success}

> "Dominating!!"
{.is-success}

> "Rampage!!"
{.is-success}

> "Mega Copy!!"
{.is-success}

> "Unstoppable!!"
{.is-success}

> "Wicked Sick!!"
{.is-success}

> "Monster Copy!!!"
{.is-success}

> "GODLIKE!!!!"
{.is-danger}

> "BEYOND GODLIKE!!!!"
{.is-danger}


"GODLIKE!!!!" and "BEYOND GODLIKE!!!!" shake in red,
while the rest are in green.

# Boosting confetti
Hovering over the boost-icon on a boost-message will cause confetti to appear.
