# Discord Server Limits
This pages attempts to list the various "limitations" imposed upon servers in Discord, mostly to answer "how many X can I make?" questions. It's important to note that other than the 5,000 online user limit, **none of these can be modified**. There is currently no feature/method by which a server or user can bypass the limitations noted below.

- A user cannot be on more than **100 servers**. Once this limit is hit, any server invite will display as "Invite Expired".
- Servers have no theoretical member limit - there are servers with tens of thousands of users (75k+ in once instance). 
- Servers reaching 5000 *simultaneous online* members will need to contact Support to be moved to hardware supporting larger servers - this is when members start getting "Server Unavailable" errors.
- Servers will show offline users only until it reaches **100 members**. Once 100 members are reached, offline/invisible people no longer appear in the member list.
- A server can have *at most* **500 channels** - both text and voice combined. Once 500 channels are reached, no more channels can be created.
- A server can have *at most* **250 roles**. 
- A server can have *at most* **50 regular and 50 animated emojis**.
