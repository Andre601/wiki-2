# Discord Server Limits
This page lists the various "limitations" imposed upon servers in Discord, mostly to answer "how many X can I make?" questions. It's important to note that other than the 5,000 online user limit, **none of these can be modified**. There is currently no feature/method by which a server or user can bypass the limitations noted below.

- A user cannot be on more than **100 servers**. Once this limit is hit, any server invite will display as "Invite Expired".
- Servers have no theoretical member limit - there are servers with tens of thousands of users (75k+ in once instance). 
- Servers reaching **5,000** *simultaneous online* members will need to contact Support to be moved to hardware supporting larger servers - this is when members start getting "Server Unavailable" errors.
- Servers can have up to **250,000** total members (this cap can be raised by support).
- A server can have *at most* **500 channels** - text, voice, and categories combined. Once 500 channels are reached, no more channels can be created.
- A server can have *at most* **250 roles**. 
- Emoji limits
	- No server boost: **50 regular and 50 animated emojis**
	- Tier 1 server boost: **100 regular and 100 animated emojis**
	- Tier 2 server boost: **150 regular and 150 animated emojis**
	- Tier 3 server boost: **250 regular and 250 animated emojis**
- Servers reaching **1,000** members have the offline members list removed.
- Online members are removed at **100,000** members. Then, only hoisted roles will show.
