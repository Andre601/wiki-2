# Discord Server Limits
This page lists the various "limitations" imposed upon servers in Discord, mostly to answer "how many X can I make?" questions. It's important to note that other than the 5,000 online user limit, **none of these can be modified**. There is currently no feature/method by which a server or user can bypass the limitations noted below.

- A user cannot be on more than **100 servers**. Once this limit is hit, any server invite will display as "Invite Expired".
- Servers have no theoretical member limit - there are servers with tens of thousands of users (75k+ in once instance). 
- Servers reaching **5,000** *simultaneous online* members will need to contact Support to be moved to hardware supporting larger servers - this is when members start getting "Server Unavailable" errors.
- A server can have *at most* **500 channels** - text, voice, and categories combined. Once 500 channels are reached, no more channels can be created.
- A server can have *at most* **250 roles**. 
- A server can have *at most* **50 regular and 50 animated emojis**. 
- Servers reaching **1,000** members have the offline members list removed.

# Other Limits
- Message limit: **2,000 characters**. (note: user/channel/role mentions and emojis contain more characters than are shown)
- TTS message limit: **200 characters**.
- Pinned messages limit: **50** messages
- Reactions per message: **20** reactions.
- Maximum attachment size: **8 MB (or 8388608 bytes to be exact)**.
- Maximum attachment size with Nitro: **50 MB (or 52428800 bytes to be exact)**.
- Minimum time for idling: **10 minutes**.
- Username/nickname: **32 characters**.
