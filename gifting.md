# Gifting
Gifting is a feature that was released on December 20th, 2018. This feature allows users to gift games and Nitro subscriptions. Gifts are shared through links, specifically through the `https://discord.gift` domain. These links can be created via the Gift Inventory. Users, including the one who bought the gift, can click these links to redeem the gift. However, links can be modified by Discord to have them unable to be self-redeemed; an example being the HypeSquad Snowgivings Nitro gift.

## Game Gifting

Gifting games is done through the Discord Store. In the Payment Type step of buying a game, the `Is this a gift?` option is available to toggle. Nitro-only games cannot be purchased as gifts. Once the game is bought as a gift, it is stored in the Gift Inventory. Gift links expire after 48 hours of being unclaimed.

## Nitro Gifting

Nitro gifting is done through the Nitro section of User Settings. Unlike the game gifting process, the gift option is linked underneath the main buttons to buy Nitro. Both Nitro and Nitro Classic can be gifted, but only users with the same subscription type are able to redeem that said subscription type. Users without either subscription can accept both. Nitro links expire after 48 hours.

### Snowgivings Nitro Gift

Gifting was introduced with a Nitro gift given to all HypeSquad members that joined before December 18th, 2018; these gifts are unable to be self-redeemed and have to be shared to other users. These were given as an end to the HypeSquad Snowgivings event.
