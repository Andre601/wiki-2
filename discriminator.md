# Discriminator
A discriminator is the number displayed next to someone's username on Discord. Discriminators are how Discord differentiates between users with the same username.

![Discriminator Example](/uploads/discriminator-example.png "Discriminator Example")

Discriminators range from 0001 to 9999 and are randomly assigned. Two users with the same username may not have the same discriminator and if you change your username to something where a user with that name already has your discriminator, your discriminator will automatically change itself.

 > NOTE: You cannot create a username for which all discriminator spots have been taken. If you attempt to change to a username for which all discriminator slots are taken, Discord will return an error.

## Changing your Discriminator
Changing your discriminator is possible once every 24 hours. However, it is prohibited to "discriminator farm" (using a bot to change your username until you get the discriminator you wish), and as a result, The Discord Wiki will not condone the use of discriminator farms. We also heavily advise against manually changing your username to find the discriminator you desire, but it is technically permitted.
