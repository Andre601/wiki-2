# Discriminator
A discriminator is the number displayed next to someone's username on Discord. Discriminators are how Discord differentiates between users with the same username.

![EXAMPLE DISCRIM](http://i.thedrutribe.us/b19baba2.png)

Discriminators range from 0001 to 9999 and are randomly assigned. Two users with the name username may not have the same discriminator and if you change your username to something where a user with that name already has your discriminator, your discriminator will automatically change itself.

Once all the discriminators are taken for a username, Discord will not allow you to make that your username.

### Changing your Discriminator
Changing your discriminator is possible. However, it's unrecommended by Discord so this Wiki will not teach you how to do it.
