# Overview
What is Quick Switcher, may you ask? Well, Quick Switcher is a panel that allows you to jump between different channels, servers and direct messages *quickly* (duh, like why even make a thing called 'Quick Switcher' if it was slow).

To pull up the Quick Switcher, press Ctrl + K if you're on Windows, and Cmd + K on macOS. Alternatively, you can also use Ctrl + T on Windows or Cmd + T on macOS.

# Usage

To visit a server, direct message or channel of your choice, type the the intended channel name into the box that says "Where would you like to go today?" As you type, suggestions will come up that relate to your query. Once you find a channel, server or direct message you wish to be insta-zapped to, navigate to it with your cursor and click on it.

> NOTE: You can also use the tab/arrow keys to select a channel, if you wish.

If you want to close the Quick Switcher, click the escape key or click anywhere outside of it.

> NOTE: You can filter your search with a prefix
> ```text
> ! for voice channels
> * for guilds/servers
> # for text channels
> @ for users
> ```
> 

Finally, any unread mentions, any unread channels in the current server and your last visited channel will display on the Quick Switcher!
