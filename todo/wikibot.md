<!-- SUBTITLE: Discordia's Discord WikiBot -->

Discord WikiBot is a simple, yet effective tool that grabs articles from the Discord Wiki and Discord [Helpdesk](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us). It's like a nice little wingman that can grab different books for you at the library! 

Currently the Discord Wikibot is only available on very few servers as itâ€™s intended to be almost exclusively on Discord-run servers.
