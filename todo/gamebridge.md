<!-- SUBTITLE: An integration for Game developers -->

GameBridge is an SDK allowing developers of games to integrate Discord into their games. GameBridge is still in closed Beta, and you need to apply for it.

Features include:
* Automatch players in voice channels
* Integrated Sharing of Screenshots, GIFs and Videos
* Auto-Create permanent or temporary Servers for Ingame-Worlds/Guilds
* Building up a community (Partner-like benefits)
* Controlling Audio Settings
* Positional Audio (Voices placed in a virtual space to augment distribution of players)

At the moment the [GameBridge-Website](https://discordapp.com/gamebridge) shows a few games which support GameBridge. GameBridge's Documentation can be found [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gamebridge).
