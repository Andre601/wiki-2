<!--TITLE: Discord Web -->

Discord Web is the accessible client on Web Browsers. This allows users without a mobile device or a compatible computer to access Discord. The website for Discord is https://discordapp.com. You will need to be logged in to access it.

# Requirements
Discord recommends using a modern browser such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera. Other actively maintaned web browsers may also be supported.

# Lacking Features
Discord Web lacks features which are on Discord Client due to limitations.

* It lacks system-wide Push To Talk (PTT); this means that you cannot use Push To Talk unless you are focused on the Discord Web page. For further clarificaiton, you cannot engage the PTT whilst actively using Microsoft Word with Google Chrome minimised or behind Word.
* It does not support Screen Sharing; this means you cannot see other users when they screenshare and you cannot screenshare yourself.
* It does not support Video Chat; this means you cannot talk to other users with your webcam turned on.
* You cannot change the Audio Input and Output devices on the Web client, it's only set to the default audio device, or the one set by the web browser.
* You cannot right click on messages to delete or pin or react to them. You need to use the three dots on the side-end of the message.
* Advanced features it misses is Hardware Acceleration and Zoom Level.
