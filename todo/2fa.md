<!-- TITLE: Two-Factor Authentication -->

This is part of the [User Settings](/user-settings) in Discord.

# Definition
Two-Factor Authentication (short 2FA) is an additional layer of Security to your Account. Usually when logging into Discord all you need to enter is an Email address and a Password. With Two-Factor Authentication set up, you will additionally need to enter a Verification Code generated by an App like Google Authenticator or Authy on your Phone. Servers can also enable the Requirement of a 2FA code to perform some administrative actions on the Server in the Server Settings. If 2FA is not enabled, you will need to confirm every new Login IP or location through an E-Mail sent to your account.
Setting up Two-Factor Authentication

To enable Two-Factor Authentication, open your User Settings by clicking the Cog Wheel on the bottom right of your Screen, click on Security and press "Enable Two-Factor Auth". You will need to have your Account claimed using an E-Mail address. Then either scan the QR code using the Authenticator Application or manually enter the code shown below it into the App instead. The App will then generate a code for you which you have to enter at the bottom of the page. After setting it up, a site will show you all of your Backup codes. Store these Backup codes somewhere other than your PC as they will be required in case you lose your phone. You can view them in the Security Menu in the User Settings by entering your Password afterwards.
Backup Codes

You will require Backup Codes in case you lose your phone or have no access to it otherwise. After entering your Email and Password when being asked to enter a 2FA code you can click the text below it and enter one of these Backup Codes.
'''Each backup code can only be used once.'''
Disabling 2FA

You can disable Two-factor Authentication in your User Security Settings. Previously generated 2FA codes will stop working, Discord will no longer prompt for 2FA codes, and IP confirmation will be required again.
