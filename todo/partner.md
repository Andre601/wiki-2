# Becoming a Discord Partner
To get a chance for Discord partnership, go to the [Discord Partnership page](http://discordapp.com/partners) and fill out the application.

According to their website, Discord looks for 'growing communities and content creators that show an authentic enthusiasm for Discord (which means youâ€™re already using Discord for your community). We want to support communities that support us. Acceptance into the program is extremely qualitative and will vary from one candidate to the next.'

**Specific communities that are usually accepted include:**
* Reddits (8000+ subs)
* Social Personalities (Large facebook, twitter, etc online personalities [10,000+ followers])
* Content Creators/Streamers (Beam, Twitch, YouTube, Player.me, etc)
* Non-Profits (100% acceptance if you can provide your EID)
* Large Communities (Large guilds or gaming groups)

(Not all the values given are dead set, everything is based on who/what you are and do. Everyone has a chance, but these are the low-averages for a partner.)
*Twitch Partners and registered nonprofits are guaranteed Discord Partners.*
