If you're going to make use of the Discord API, for instance to create a [bot](/bots), then Discord's *Developer Mode* will be of great help to you.

# How to enable it
Enabling Developer Mode is easy. Open your Discord settings (the <i class="icon-cog"></i> next to your name at the bottom left) and click on _Appearance_. There you will find _Developer Mode_. Click the checkbox enable it.

# What does it even do then
Developer Mode adds a simple _Copy ID_ option to your context menu. Right click on any server, user, message or channel to get its unique ID.
