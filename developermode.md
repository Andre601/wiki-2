<!-- TITLE: Developer Mode -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: It'll seriously help you in life. -->

If you're going to make use of the Discord API, for instance to create a [bot](https://discordia.me/bots), then Discord's *Developer Mode* will be of great help to you.

# How to enable it
Enabling it is easy: just open your Discord settings (you know, the <i class="icon-cog"></i> next to your name at the bottom left) and click on _Appearance_. There you will find the magical _Developer Mode_ option for you to click on with your mouse to enable.

# What does it even do then
So why is this mode so helpful, you ask? It adds a simple _Copy ID_ option to your context menu. Just right click on anything that moves and it'll obey you. Okay, I was just kidding. Right click on any server, user, message or channel and it will give you their ID.
