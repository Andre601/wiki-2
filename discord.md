Discord is a free text and voice-based social software directed towards gamers. With over 130 million users and counting, Discord continues to grow and has many updates and awesome features.

Discord is developed by Discord Inc. (previously known as Hammer and Chisel), by the former developers of the OpenFeint software, which was a very popular mobile gaming platform for iOS and Android until 2012. Jason Citron, the founder, went ahead to develop Discord with a group of amazing employees, and were also known for the popular mobile game MOBA: Fates Forever.

The website for Discord is https://discordapp.com.
