<!-- TITLE: Join And Leave Messages -->

Join and Leave messages are special system messages that appear in the default channel of a server when a user leaves or joins a server. Currently, it is experimental and limited to 5% of newly created servers ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/68hpid/how_to_get_rid_of_join_messages/dgyz653/)). Additionally, join and leave messages automatically turn off once your server reaches 20 members ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/6a6jhb/discord_automatically_welcomes_user_and_i_want_to/dhc2a1i/)).
