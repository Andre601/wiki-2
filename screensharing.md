<!-- TITLE:Screensharing -->
<!-- SUBTITLE:Coming Soon! -->

Screensharing is an unreleased feature which will allow the user to capture and transmit their screen content to other discord users. Along with screensharing, video chatting is also being developed.

# Status
Screensharing is currently in the **internal testing** phase.
# Limitations
Screensharing will probably only be available in the Desktop version of Discord, as neither the web version nor the mobile versions have the necessary ingredients to access the screen content. Also it will only be released to [Group DMs and DMs](/direct-messages).

> Disclaimer: This is an unreleased feature and it might change before it is opened to Canary users. It might not be released at all, and an ETA is not available.
