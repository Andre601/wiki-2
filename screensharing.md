<!-- TITLE: Screensharing -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Coming Soon! -->

Screensharing is an unreleased feature which will allow the user to capture and transmit their screen content to other discord users. Also developed at the same time is Video Chat.

# Status
The current status of screensharing is **Internal Testing**. NOW STOP LOOKING AT MY CAPITALIZATION
# Limitations
Screensharing will probably only be available in the Desktop version of Discord, as neither the web version nor the mobile versions have the necessary ingredients to access the screen content. Also it will only be released to [Group DMs and DMs](/direct-messages) as they won't go over a server though instead will use a P2P connection between Users.

> Disclaimer: This is an unreleased feature and it might change before it is opened to Canary users. It might not be released at all, and an ETA is not available.
