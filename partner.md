# Becoming a Discord Partner

As of [August 3rd, 2020](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001494012), the Discord Partner program was changed to reward more active servers than servers with a large following outside of Discord. Now, to be eligible for the Discord Partner program, a server must meet the Activity Requirements listed in the Partner Program section of Server Insights. Partnership is not automatic and users still have to fill out an application.

Partnership may also be removed at any time when the requirements, as described in the Server insight's Partner Programm section, are no longer met for an extended period of time.
