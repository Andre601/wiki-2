# Becoming a Discord Partner

As of August 3rd, 2020, the Discord Partner program was changed to reward more active servers than servers with a large following outside of Discord. Now, to be eligible for the Discord Partner program, a server must meet the Activity Requirements listed in the Partner Program section of Server Insights. Partnership is not automatic and users still have to fill out an application.
