## Connections Menu

Pressing any of the icons on the page will direct you to a login page to connect your account. The only exceptions to this are Skype and League of Legends, as these connections require the corresponding desktop application to be open. These connections are also unavailable on mobile and the browser client.

In this menu, you can also see your connected accounts, manage settings (such as Display on profile, or more specific settings as Display Spotify as your status) for them, and disconnect them from your Discord account.
