On the Connections tab, you may connect a Twitch, Youtube, Skype, Steam, Reddit or Twitter account to your Discord account under the Connected Accounts menu. Click on a respective icon to connect an account from that website. From here you may also toggle whether or not Discord can automatically detect accounts from other platforms or not on your device.

Under the connections icons, you will see all your linked accounts and whether or not you want to display it on your profile or if you want to sync friends from that platform to Discord.

Under the Authorized Apps menu, you will be able to see which Discord API apps have access to what information related to your account. From here you may also remove authorized apps by hovering over them and clicking the Delete button.

On Browser, the Skype and Steam options are unavailable. On Mobile, this menu does not exist.
