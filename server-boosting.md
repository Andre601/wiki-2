Discord allows users with Nitro to *boost* a Discord Server, which can unlock various perks for the entire server.

# Getting Boosts
You can purchase boosts in two ways:
- If you subscribe to/are gifted [Nitro](/en/nitro), you get 2 free Boosts and a discount on separately purchased Boosts.
- You can also pay for Boosts separately from Nitro.

If you have Nitro Classic, you won't get any free boosts but you will get the discount.

# Boost levels
Depending on how many Boosts a server has, it unlocks new levels.

## Level 1
Can be unlocked with 2 boosts, meaning that a single Nitro user could unlock it.

This level unlocks the following perks:
- 50 additional Slots for both animated and normal Emotes (100 normal and 100 animated in total)
- 128 Kbps Audio quality for voice chat (Compared to the normal 96 Kbps)
- Option to set an animated Server icon
- Option to set a custom background for the Invite screen
- 720p 60fps Go Live Streaming

## Level 2
Can be unlocked with 15 boosts.

This level unlocks the following perks:
- 50 additional Slots for animated and normal emotes (150 normal and 150 animated in total)
- 256 Kbps Audio quality for voice chat
- Option to set a server banner (Visible at the top of the channel selection)
- 50MB upload limit for all Members on the Discord
- 1080p 60fps Go Live Streaming

## Level 3
Can be unlocked with 30 boosts and is the highest level a Discord can reach.

This level unlocks the following perks:
- 100 additional Slots for animated and normal emotes (250 normal and 250 animated in total)
- 384 Kbps Audio quality for voice chat
- Option to set a vanity URL (discord.gg/yourVanityUrl)
- 100MB upload limit for all Members on the Discord

# Losing boosts
The server will lose boosts when a server booster either moves their Boost(s) to another server, or their Nitro/Boost subscription expires.
Servers have a "grace period" of 3 days before they actually lose the level in case the booster forgot to renew their subscription or similar.
