Discord allows users with Nitro to *boost* a Discord Server, which can unlock different perks depending on what Levels the Discord Server has reached.

# How to boost
Users with Discord Nitro have the ability to boost a Discord either once or even twice depending on their type of Nitro.  
Users with classic Nitro have one free boost while users with normal Nitro have two.

Additionally can everyone buy boosts themself to use on a Discord of their choice.

# Boost levels
Depending on how many Boosts a Discord Server has can it unlock a different level (or tier how it is called too).

## Level 1
Can be unlocked with 2 boosts, meaning that a single Nitro user could unlock it.

This level unlocks the following perks:
- 50 additional Slots for both animated and normal Emotes (100 normal and 100 animated in total)
- 128 Kbps Audio quality for voice chat (Compared to the normal 96 Kbps)
- Option to set an animated Server icon
- Option to set a custom background for the Invite screen
- 720p 60fps Go Live Streaming

## Level 2
Can be unlocked with 15 boosts.

This level unlocks the following perks:
- 50 additional Slots for animated and normal emotes (150 normal and 150 animated in total)
- 256 Kbps Audio quality for voice chat
- Option to set a server banner (Visible at the top of the channel selection)
- 50MB upload limit for all Members on the Discord
- 1080p 60fps Go Live Streaming

## Level 3
Can be unlocked with 30 boosts and is the highest level a Discord can reach.

This level unlocks the following perks:
- 100 additional Slots for animated and normal emotes (250 normal and 250 animated in total)
- 384 Kbps Audio quality for voice chat
- Option to set a vanity URL (discord.gg/yourVanityUrl)
- 100MB upload limit for all Members on the Discord

# Losing boosts
Your Discord Server will lose boosts, when the Booster either moves the boost to another Discord Server, or his Nitro expires.  
Discord Servers have a "Grace period" before they actually lose the boost, to prevent losing a level, if the booster just forgot to renew his subscription (or similar).  
The Grace period is 3 days.
