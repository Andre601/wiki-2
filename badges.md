Discord has different badges that distinguish a user as a member of specific groups. Badges display on a user's profile card. To access someone's profile card, click them and select **view profile** by hovering over their avatar. 

Badges appear in a hierarchical order, and multiple badges will stack.

# General Badges
If a user has multiple badges, all badges that the user has will appear.

# Discord Staff <img src="https://github.com/DiscordiaWiki/wiki/blob/master/uploads/icons/discord-staff.png?raw=true" alt="Discord Staff Badge" width="21" height="21"/>
This badge is issued to all Discord Staff. The badge distinguishes users from staff members, and prevents impersonation by non-Discord employees.

Discord [Partners](/partner) have the Partner badge on their profile. As the Partner perks only go to the server owner, only users that own a Partnered server can receive this badge.

You can receive any of the HypeSquad House badges by taking the HypeSquad quiz in the [Discord settings](https://discordapp.com/settings/hypesquad-online). If you want to join Bravery, answer using the first option for all questions. If you want to join Brilliance, use the second option for all questions, and for Balance, use the third option. If you want to be randomly assigned to a house, use the last option for all questions.
