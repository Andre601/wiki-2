Discord has different badges that distinguish a user as a member of specific groups. Badges display on a user's profile card. To access someone's profile card, click them and select 'view profile' by hovering over their avatar. 

The following badges are listed in hierarchical order.
# Discord Staff
This badge is issued to all Discord Staff. If someone claims to be Discord Staff and does not have this badge, it is very likely they're impersonating. This badge is one of the only official ways Discord Staff are distinguishable from regular users.
