# Discord Homepage
On Discord's website [homepage](https://discordapp.com) there are many objects that when clicked cause a small object (usually mario related) to appear on the screen.

One example of the clickable objects is the question-box towards the top of the page.

# Remixed Ringtone
In ultra rare cases, users will receive a remixed version of the incoming call ringtone during either a group or two-person voice call. If a user receives the remixed ringtone, it will play for the whole duration of the call instead of ending when the user joins the call. According to Discord staff, this is the rarest easteregg. You may hear the remixed ringtone by downloading it [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/258797935712534528/274717813636202496/discord.wav).
# Secret Keybord Combo
From the Keyboard Combinations menu you may enter a secrey command that plays an animation based on the [Sun Goku Satsu](
http://streetfighter.wikia.com/wiki/Shun_Goku_Satsu) attack from Street Fighter games.

To view this easter egg first pull up the Keybord Combo menu by typing 'control /' on a Windows computer or 'Command /' on a Macintosh. This can't be done via the Discord mobile apps. 

Once on the Keybord Combo menu, type the command 'hh[right arrow] nk'. Typing this command will display the animation on your screen. You may view the animation [here](http://i.imgur.com/yV4M1jh.gif).
