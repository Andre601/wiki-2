# Introduction
At The Unofficial Discord Wiki, we collect and manage user data according to the following Privacy Policy, with the goal of incorporating our company values: transparency, accessibility, sanity, usability. This document is part of The Unofficial Discord Wiki's [Terms of Service](https://discordia.me/terms), and by using https://discordia.me (the “Services”), you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.

# Data Collection
We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Services to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.

### Google Analytics
We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Additionally, we use a subfeature of Google Analytics called Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. This feature allows us to gain aggregated information about our users, their age ranges, their gender, and general interests of our users to provide you with more relevant information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser, or by installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

We ask you to log in and provide certain personal information (such as your name and email address) in order to be able to save your profile and the documents and comments associated with it. In order to enable these or any other login based features, we use cookies to store session information for your convenience. You can block or delete cookies and still be able to use The Unofficial Discord Wiki, although if you do you will then be asked for your username and password every time you log in to the Services. In order to take advantage of certain features of the Services, you may also choose to provide us with other personal information, such as your picture or personal website, but your decision to utilize these features and provide such data will always be voluntary.
