<!-- SUBTITLE: Using Two-Factor Authentication on Discord -->

Two-Factor Authentication is a second step security measure when logging into Discord. It is not required, but reccomended for safety purposes. 
# Enabling 2FA
Download an authenticator app (such as Authy or Google Authenticator) and open Discord. Once on Discord, go to your user settings and click on 'Enable Two-Factor Auth' under the 'My Account' tab. Once the pop-up appears, scan the QR code or enter the 2FA Key into your authentication app. The authentication app should begin to generate 6 digit codes. Enter a code onto Discord where prompted and click on 'Active'. 

When logging into Discord when 2FA is enabled, you will be required to enter an authentication code *after* you enter your password (this is not a substitue). 

**Please note: Discord Support cannot disable 2FA from your account, only you can. If you do not have a backup code and you lock yourself out of your account, you are most likely unable to recover it.**

# Backup Codes
In case you are unable to generate a code, Discord provides you with backup codes. You may grab your backup codes at anytime you are logged in by clicking on 'View Backup Codes' under the 'My Account' tab in user settings. **Do not share these backup codes with anyone.** We also reccomend that you save these backup codes in a safe place in case you get locked out of your authentication app. Each Backup code only works once. 

# Disabling 2FA
To disable two-factor authentication, click 'Remove 2FA' under the 'My Account' tab in user settings. You must be logged into Discord to do this. 

# Server T2FA
If you are the Server Owner, you can enable Server Two-Factor Authentication which requires staff to have two-factor authentication enabled on their account to do "dangerous administrative actions". To enable this, click on 'Enable 2FA Requirement' under the 'Moderation' tab in server settings. You will be required to enter a 6 digit code to do this.
