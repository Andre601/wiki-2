So, where can you find Audit Logs? Inside [server settings](/server-settings), there's a tab labeled Audit Logs.

> **NOTE**: You can only view Audit Logs if you have either the **View Audit Logs** or the **Administrator** permissions.

Once you've clicked the Audit Logs tab, you'll be greeted with something that looks like this:
