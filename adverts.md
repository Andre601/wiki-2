# That Sidebar Advertisement and You

Hey there, I'm SleepaDru#7700! I'm the guy with the wallet, the guy who works overnights, and also the guy who you're probably not liking very much right now. You're thinking: "Wow, you seem a bit pretentious to be running an advertisement on this site and asking me as the end user not to block it." But hear me out please, before you start your long rant to me. The entire team here has been running the Wiki for an entire year now, believe it or not, and the cost of running everything really adds up. Currently to run this server and keep it stable with all of the requests that go through it, it costs about $150USD a month to run the Wiki. Now, with the job I have now, that's not too big of a bite of my wallet, but I do pay everything out of pocket. If I were to lose the job I have currently for whatever reason, the Wiki as a whole would have to be shut down. The Wiki has been, and will continue to be, completely nonprofit, so anything that isn't being used to directly fund the wiki or improve its content will be donated directly to the [Special Effect](https://www.specialeffect.org.uk) charity.

## Are you gonna put more advertisements?
We have no plans to put any more advertisements, just that lovely sidebarboi.

## Why do you have ads when Discord doesn't?
The Unofficial Discord Wiki isn't affiliated with Discord whatsoever, we're just an informationbase about the service. Running all of the server stuff that we do is expensive as booty as stated above :3

## What will you do with the extra money?
Any leftovers after costs have been paid will be donated to [Special Effect](https://www.specialeffect.org.uk). Here's a little bit from them:

> We put fun and inclusion back into the lives of people with physical disabilities by helping them to play video games.
> By using technology ranging from modified joypads to eye-control, we're finding a way for people to play to the very best of their abilities. But we're not just doing it for fun. By levelling the playing field, we're bringing families and friends together and having a profoundly positive impact on therapy, confidence and rehabilitation.
