# Official Support Routes and Information
## Official Servers
* Discord Testers, the one where you discuss beta versions of Discord, and help improve them by pointing out bugs: https://discord.gg/discord-testers
* Discord Feedback, the one where you provide helpful feedback on how to improve Discord as a service: https://discord.gg/discord-feedback
* Discord Events, the one where you discover new events that Discord is attending, and meet Wumpus: https://discord.gg/events

## Community Support Servers

At The Unofficial Discord Wiki, we aim to provide information about anything and everything you might want to know about Discord.
We also provide general discord support on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZRJ9Ghh) if you need help getting your mic working, or need a quick answer to a question.

There is also a number of other community support servers:
* Discord API, where you learn how to make your bot better, *not how to code one in the first place*: https://discord.gg/discord-api
* Discord Bots, the second place you should go to test your bot out after you put it on a test server: https://discord.gg/0cDvIgU2voWn4BaD

## Regarding Community Support
Discord Developers has been a major server that's been around since the beginning of Discord, but has since been deprecated in favor of two different servers (Discord Testers and Discord Feedback). Discord has left https://dis.gd/contact as a support link for users, but for more instant feedback, they rely on community support servers to assist. We've listed a few above, however, for issues regarding banned accounts or any issues that need to be resolved with Discord Staff explicitly, we at The Unofficial Discord Wiki recommend against community support. Please use the link above for major issues.
