<!-- TITLE: Server Settings -->

The settings below are specific to servers.

# Tabs

## Overview
Within the Overview tab, users with the Manage Server permission can change the icon, name, and server region of the server. The Verification level can also be changed. Verification levels include:
Low - A user must have a verified email on their Discord account.
Medium - In addition to Low, must be registered for more than 5 minutes. 
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ - In addition to Low and Medium, must be in the server for 10 minutes.

The Default Notification settings are also in this channel, and include "All messages" or "Only @mentions." "Only @mentions" being enabled is recommended for public Discord servers.

## Instant Invites
In this tab, users with the Manage Server permission can see instant invites created on the server. It shows the duration of an invite, the creator, the channel, and the number of uses on it. Users can also delete these invites by pressing the Revoke button on the right of the invite.

## Integrations

Users with the Manage Server permission can add their *partnered* Twitch or Youtube Gaming accounts to the server. This allows you to sync your Subscribers (Twitch) or your Sponsors (Youtube Gaming) to a role on your Discord Server. 

## Members

In this tab, users with Manage Server can view Members. Users with Manage Nicknames can change nicknames, server owners can Transfer Ownership, users with Kick Members can kick, users with Ban Members can ban, and users with Manage Roles can add or remove roles from users, if that user is below them in the hierarchy. 

## Roles

In this tab, users with Manage Roles can edit settings on roles below their top role. Managing roles means that users can delete the role, rename the role, change the role's color, and manage permissions on the role. Adding permissions you don't have to roles is not possible, and removing permissions that are only given to you by that role is also not possible.

## Bans

This tab allows you to search the banned members and unban, if you have the Ban Members permission.

## Emoji

In this tab, users with Manage Emoji can rename emojis, upload new ones, view who uploaded them, and delete emojis. There is a 50 emoji limit per server, and users may only use emojis in that server, unless they have [Discord Nitro](/nitro). More info about emojis can be found [here](/emoji).

## Widget

The Widget tab has options for users who have Manage Server to edit the widget for the server. Users can enable the widget, and pick a channel for the widget to link to. If no channel is selected, only the online count and voice channels will be shown. A iframe widget is availiable to embed directly onto your website. A JSON API widget is also availiable. 

## Webhooks

This tab allows users with the Manage Webhooks permission to create, edit, delete, and view who made a webhook. More info about Webhooks can be found [here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhook).

## Security 

This tab is only availiable to the server owner, and allows them to enable a server-wide 2FA requirement. This requires users to have 2FA enable to have administrative abilities, such as banning members and accessing server settings.

## Vanity URL

This tab is only availiable to users with Manage Server, and only to servers that are partnered. More information about partners can be found [here](/partner), or [here](https://discordapp.com/partners).
