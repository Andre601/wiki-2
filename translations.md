*Currently we mainly need the home page, the TOS and the privacy policy translated. These should be as accurately translated as possible.*

## TM
*Below there are a few things by language you should follow to ensure translations are as consistent as possible. The language translators are encouraged to add things they think are important.*
### Global TM
*This is important for all languages.*
* Don't prefer machine translating to actually writing it out.
* Try avoiding dialects
* If the article is about Discord and has an explanation for a feature, be sure to use words that are actually in Discord, for example buttons. The article has to reflect the Discord texts in the app.
* Translations need to be accurate to the english version. If there's information missing you'd like to add, add it to the english one beforehand.
* The formatting needs to look the same, you can copy it over.
### German
* Use *Sie* instead of *Du*
