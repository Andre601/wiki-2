Hey kids. As the year draws to a close, it's good to look back and see everything that we've done together, as well as discussing projects for the future!

First off, I'd personally like to thank all of the staff who have made this little project of ours an extraordinary success. We really did work as a team to accomplish all that we have in 2017, and my heart swells with pride every time I think back to how we started. 

## A Not-So-Humble Beginning
You see, we didn't initially plan to make the Wiki at all, nor did we plan on making the server public. Back when we first started, we made the server when the Discordian role was removed from Discord Developers, and we got butt-hurt and made a new server to basically make the name live on. A couple hours after, Mike came up with the idea to call the first server 'Discordia' and our story began. We struggled for a bit to think of a niche, but after a few days, we settled upon being a server that'd become known for friendly and efficient support as to take some of the burden off of Discord Developers.

## Growth
In just a year, we've grown massively, and that's really all thanks to you folks out there supporting us! We've gone from zero visits to over 10 thousand monthly! We've had to fight past every My Little Pony wiki out there, and we're now one of the top 5 Google results for anyone searching for a Discord Wiki thingymabob. We also had the chance to launch a Patreon, and we can't thank those who have donated so far enough.

## A Peek to the Future
As we look to the future, we'd like to announce some projects that we're working on!

The initial WikiBot 1.0 is less than subpar, and we acknowledge that. We're sorry about it even. That's why we're working with immensely talented developers to come up with a new WIkiBot, and it's gonna be BIGGER, and BADDER, and it's gonna be TOO MUCH FOR MR. INCREDIBLE! This new bot is currently being worked on by Wizardλ#5679, space#0302, and Legofury#9425, and should be ready sometime in early to mid 2018!

Finally, we're going to continue to make the Wiki accessible to more and more people by opening up language applications to any language that we currently don't have! If you've got a friend who speaks another language and they want to help out on a team passionate about Discord, just send them over!

We can't express our love for you folks enough. We thank you all from the bottom of our heart for joining us on this journey, and we can't wait to see what 2018 has in store.
