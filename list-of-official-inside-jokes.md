<!-- TITLE: List of Official Inside Jokes -->

Due to Discord's tongue-in-cheek nature on social media, coupled with the populatiry of the app itself, Discord has ended up spawning several inside jokes among it's users on official servers. 

**Do note that, due to the nature of inside jokes, a majority of these jokes may no longer be considered funny.  Joke with caution.**

# Softsoap
Softsoap is a brand of soap, most primarily in the forms of hand soap and body wash, that was first created in 1980 by Robert R. Taylor, before being sold to the Colgate company seven years later.  Softsoap is often found in Discord's Game Night streams, though it also occasionally cameos in "new feature" videos. (for example, a bottle of *Pomegranate and Mango Infusions* Softsoap can be found in the background of [Discord's Nitro Brew Coffee April Fools video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z4GW6Vd6NI))  The two most referenced bottles of Softsoap are *"Pomegranate and Mango Infusions Bodywash"* in 18 fl oz. quantity and *"Lavender & Chamomile Hand Soap"* in 7.5 fl oz quantity.

The inside joke's debut was in the October 2016 Game Night stream, in which Discord staff member Zencha frequently transitions his sentences into advertisements for *Pomegranate and Mango Infusions* Softsoap, claiming that it will give the customer "silky smooth skin".
