Markdown is a Discord feature that enables the stylizing of text. There are a total of five different markdown operators.

# Operators
## Bold Text
This is done with two asterisks (\*\*) on both sides of text selected. 
For example: `**The apple is sweet**`.

![A 5 F 8 D 0](/uploads/markdown/a-5-f-8-d-0.png "Bolded markdown in typing window.")

This would make the text appear as: 

![O 5 Ucyb 0](/uploads/o-5-ucyb-0.png "Bolded text in chat.")

## Italicized Text
This is done with one asterisk (\*) or underscore (\_) on both sides of text selected. For example: `*The apple is sweet*` or `_The apple is sweet_`.

![6 E 34 Bc](/uploads/markdown/6-e-34-bc.png "Italicized markdown in typing window.")

![Bcb 156](/uploads/markdown/bcb-156.png "Italicized markdown in typing window.")

This would make the text appear as:

![Vjpiq 9 U](/uploads/vjpiq-9-u.png "Italicized text in chat.")

## Strike-through Text
This is done with two tildes (\~\~) on both sides of text selected. For example: `~~The apple is sweet~~`.

![56992 E](/uploads/markdown/56992-e.png "Strikethrough markdown in typing window.")

This would make the text appear as:

![9 Ruvg 9 B](/uploads/9-ruvg-9-b.png "Strikethrough text in chat.")

## Inline Code Blocks
Using one backtick (\`) you can create an inline code block. They don't take up a line on their own compared to Code Blocks themselves. You can't style them though unlike full Code Blocks.

![C 8 Ca 1 F](/uploads/markdown/c-8-ca-1-f.png "Inline code block in typing window.")

This would make the text appear as:

![C 144 Da](/uploads/markdown/c-144-da.png "Inline code block in chat.")

## Code block formatting
Surround text with three backticks (\`\`\`) to create a Code Block, if you want colored text, follow with a Highlight.js language ID)

![A 16 Ed 5](/uploads/markdown/a-16-ed-5.png "Multiline code block in typing window")

This would make the text appear as:

![C 73 Dd 2](/uploads/markdown/c-73-dd-2.png "Multiline code block in chat, with code syntax highlighted.")

You can use multiple markdown usages together in a piece of text anywhere, and can even combine them to make ones which stand out.
