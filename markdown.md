Markdown is a Discord feature that enables the stylizing of text. There are a total of five different markdown operators.

# Operators
## Bold Text
This is done with two asterisks (\*\*) on both sides of text selected. 
For example: `**The apple is sweet**`.

![Ccxekx 9](/uploads/ccxekx-9.png "Ccxekx 9")

This would make the text appear as: 

![O 5 Ucyb 0](/uploads/o-5-ucyb-0.png "O 5 Ucyb 0")

## Italicized Text
This is done with one asterisk (\*) or underscore (\_) on both sides of text selected. For example: `*The apple is sweet*` or `_The apple is sweet_`.

![S 4 A 1 Wrj](/uploads/s-4-a-1-wrj.png "S 4 A 1 Wrj")

![Nefulom](/uploads/nefulom.png "Nefulom")

This would make the text appear as:

![Vjpiq 9 U](/uploads/vjpiq-9-u.png "Vjpiq 9 U")

## Strike-through Text
This is done with two tildes (\~\~) on both sides of text selected. For example: `~~The apple is sweet~~`.

![Jdrpa 2 B](/uploads/jdrpa-2-b.png "Jdrpa 2 B")

This would make the text appear as:

![9 Ruvg 9 B](/uploads/9-ruvg-9-b.png "9 Ruvg 9 B")

## Inline Code Blocks
Using one backtick (\`) you can create an inline code block. They don't take up a line on their own compared to Code Blocks themselves. You can't style them though unlike full Code Blocks.
## Code block formatting
surround text with three backticks (\`\`\`), if you want colored text followed by a Highlight.js language ID)

You can use multiple markdown usages together in a piece of text anywhere, and can even combine them to make ones which stand out.

A full list of code block format IDs can be found in [this server](https://discord.gg/VfVvwcX).
