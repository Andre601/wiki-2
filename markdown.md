Markdown is a Discord feature that enables the stylizing of text. There are a total of six different markdown operators in Discord.

# Operators
## Bold Text
This is done with two asterisks (\*\*) on both sides of text selected. 
For example: `**The apple is sweet**`.

This would make the text appear as: 

![Bolded Text In Chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiscordiaWiki/wiki/master/uploads/markdown/bolded-text-in-chat.png "Bolded text in chat.")

## Italicized Text
This is done with one asterisk (\*) or underscore (\_) on both sides of text selected. For example: `*The apple is sweet*` or `_The apple is sweet_`.

![Bcb 156](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiscordiaWiki/wiki/master/uploads/markdown/bcb-156.png "Italicized markdown in typing window.")

This would make the text appear as:

## Strike-through Text
This is done with two tildes (\~\~) on both sides of text selected. For example: `~~The apple is sweet~~`.

## Inline Code Blocks
Using one backtick (\`) you can create an inline code block. They don't take up a line on their own compared to Code Blocks themselves. You can't style them though unlike full Code Blocks.

This would make the text appear as:

## Code block formatting
Surround text with three backticks (\`\`\`) to create a Code Block, if you want colored text, follow with a Highlight.js language ID

![Multiline code block in typing window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiscordiaWiki/wiki/master/uploads/markdown/a-16-ed-5.png "Multiline code block in typing window.")

This would make the text appear as:

![Multiline code block in chat, with code syntax highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiscordiaWiki/wiki/master/uploads/markdown/c-73-dd-2.png "Multiline code block in chat, with code syntax highlighted.")

You can use multiple markdown usages together in a piece of text anywhere, and can even combine them to make ones which stand out.

A full list of code block format IDs can be found in [this server](https://discord.gg/VfVvwcX).

## Spoilers
You can create a spoiler by surrounding your message with two vertical bars (\|\|) if you want to hide sensitive information. People can reveal spoilers by tapping or clicking on it. You can rehide spoilers in a channel by re-entering the channel. In addition to hiding text, the spoiler tag will also cover up any media sent until the recipient chooses to reveal it.
You can also combine spoilers with other markdown formatting.

This is what an unrevealed spoiler looks like in chat:

It can be revealed by clicking or tapping on the spoiler. This is what a revealed spoiler looks like in chat:

![Revealed spoiler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiscordiaWiki/wiki/master/uploads/markdown/revealedspoiler.png "Revealedspoiler")

You can adjust the settings for showing spoilers in User Settings -> Text & Images. The *On servers I moderate* option will display spoiler content only on servers in which you have the **Manage Messages** permission.
