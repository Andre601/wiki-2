Type in what you want to search for in the search bar. For example, if you want to see all messages that contain the word "Wumpus", type Wumpus in the search bar. After a few seconds, the search results will appear. You can jump to a message by clicking on it in the results. To see more results (if applicable), click the arrows on the bottom of the results window to scroll between pages. Switch between Recent and Revelant (located on the top left of the results window) to slighty change the search results.
