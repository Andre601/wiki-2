* Automatch players in voice channels
* Integrated Sharing of Screenshots, GIFs and Videos
* Auto-Create permanent or temporary Servers for Ingame-Worlds/Guilds
* Building up a community (Partner-like benefits)
* Controlling Audio Settings
* Positional Audio (Voices placed in a virtual space to augment distribution of players)
