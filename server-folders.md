<!-- SUBTITLE: Sort your Discord servers with server folders -->

# History
Server Folders were first tested on the Canary build during mid-July 2019, being available to only some users. On July 24th, Discord teased the release of server folders in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/discordapp/status/1154128626398330880). Discord released server folders to everyone on July 25th, 2019, and also released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHo6OBRmTcI).

# Usage 
Server folders can be created by dragging a server on top of another server. By right-clicking a server folder, you can mark the folder as read, as well as access folder settings. Taking every server out of a server folder will delete the folder.

## Folder Settings

Within folder settings, you can customize the name of the folder (folders without a name simply show a short list of the servers within), as well as a custom HEX color. Having a custom color on a folder changes the folder icon to said color, and also adds a slight tint behind the folder icon when closed.
