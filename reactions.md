<!-- TITLE: Reactions -->

Reactions allow you to "react" to other people's messages. Reactions appear as a small emoji positioned below a message, along with a counter for each reaction. Reacting to a message requires the "Add Reaction" permission, however, no permissions are required in order to react to an existing reaction , already present on a message.

## Reaction denied

If you attempt to react to a person's message, and that person has you block, your reaction will not be created and your Discord client will shake violently, signalling that you cannot add a reaction to this message.
