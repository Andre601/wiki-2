Reactions allow you to "react" to other people's messages. Reactions appear as a small emoji positioned below a message, along with a counter for each reaction. Reacting to a message requires the "Add Reaction" permission, however, no permissions are required in order to react to an existing reaction, already present on a message. The counter represents how many people have reacted with that certain emoji.

As expected, users who have a Nitro subscription may react with emoji from other servers, that aren't Better TTV emojis.

## Adding reactions

You can click the add reaction icon (the small smiley with a plus sign) to bring up the emoji picker. When you click on an emoji, a reaction is added. Alternatively, you can use the "Add Reaction" sub-item of the message menu. It reveals a nested sub-menu where you can choose from your frequently used emoji to react with, and a menu item to open the emoji picker. If you do not have the "Add Reaction" permission, the add reaction icon and the "Add Reaction" sub-item will not show on any messages.

If a message has at least one reaction already present, a secondary add reaction icon appears to the last reaction.

### From the message entry box

Typing `+:emoji:` will react to the most recently sent message in the channel with that `:emoji:`. This currently only works with the desktop Discord client, and the iOS client.

### Blocked

If you attempt to react to a person's message, and that person has you blocked, your reaction will not be created and your Discord client will shake violently, signalling that you cannot add a reaction to this message.

## Managing reactions

There is a reaction modal that you can show by right-clicking on a message and clicking the "Reactions" sub-item.

Here, you can view all of the users who has reacted to the message, and with what emojis. With sufficient permissions, you can remove individual reactions.

### Removing all reactions

With the correct permissions, you can remove all of the reactions from a message, using the "Remove all Reactions" item in the message sub-menu.

## Hiding reactions

It is possible to hide reactions by toggling the "Show emoji reactions on messages" setting in the "Text & Images" subsection of the Discord client settings. This setting is **clientside only** - reactions will still work for other people if you turn this off, they are just invisible to you.

## Video

Reactions debuted on Discord on November 3rd, 2016. A video was uploaded to the Discord App YouTube channel as an announcement. Proceeding the announcement, Zencha is shown performing science experiments at a nearby park.
