<!-- TITLE: Reactions -->

Reactions allow you to "react" to other people's messages. Reactions appear as a small emoji positioned below a message, along with a counter for each reaction. Reacting to a message requires the "Add Reaction" permission, however, no permissions are required in order to react to an existing reaction, already present on a message. The counter represents how many people have reacted with that certain emoji.

As expected, users who have a Nitro subscription may react with emoji from other servers, that aren't Better TTV emojis.

## Adding reactions

You can click the add reaction icon (the small smiley with a plus sign) to bring up the emoji picker. When you click on an emoji, a reaction is added. Alternatively, you can use the "Add Reaction" sub-item of the message menu. It reveals a sub-menu where you can choose from your frequently used emoji, and a menu item to open the emoji picker. If you do not have the "Add Reaction" permission, the add reaction icon will not show on any messages, and the "Add Reaction" sub-item will not show.

### Blocked

If you attempt to react to a person's message, and that person has you block, your reaction will not be created and your Discord client will shake violently, signalling that you cannot add a reaction to this message.

## Managing reactions

There is a reaction modal that you can show by right-clicking on a message and clicking the "Reactions" sub-item.

Here, you can view all of the users who has reacted to the message, and with what emojis. With sufficient permissions, you can remove individual reactions.

### Removing all reactions

With the correct permissions, you can remove all of the reactions from a message, using the "Remove all Reactions" item in the message sub-menu.
