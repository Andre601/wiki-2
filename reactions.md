<!-- TITLE: Reactions -->

Reactions allow you to "react" to other people's messages. Reactions appear as a small emoji positioned below a message, along with a counter for each reaction. Reacting to a message requires the "Add Reaction" permission, however, no permissions are required in order to react to an existing reaction, already present on a message. The counter represents how many people have reacted with that certain emoji.

As expected, users who have a Nitro subscription may react with emoji from other servers, that aren't Better TTV emojis.

## Managing reactions

There is a reaction modal that you can show by right-clicking on a message and clicking "Reactions". Here, you can view all of the users who has reacted to the message. With sufficient permissions, you can remove individual reactions to that message.

## Reaction denied

If you attempt to react to a person's message, and that person has you block, your reaction will not be created and your Discord client will shake violently, signalling that you cannot add a reaction to this message.
