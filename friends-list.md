# Friends List
The friends list is a feature that allows to see your friends and what they're doing. The friends list was completely released on March 18th, 2016. There is a 1000 friend and blocked user limit.

## Adding Friends
Friend requests can either be sent from the profile, or the friends list page itself. The friends list page can be found when clicking the Home button, or at the top of your list of Direct Messages.

Friends can be added via their Discord username and [Discriminator](https://discordia.me/discriminator), or be suggested from your Steam or Skype friends list if those are integrated into your account.
