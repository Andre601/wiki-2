<!-- SUBTITLE: Discordia's Discord WikiBot -->

The Discord WikiBot (@Discord WikiBot#7467) is The Discord Wiki and Discordia's bot service that allows users to quickly search through this wiki and the Discord [Helpdesk](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us).

Currently the Discord Wikibot is only available on very few servers as itâ€™s intended to be almost exclusively on Discord-run servers.
