Discord Bot Developers, which own a bot that is in more than 75 simultanious servers, can apply to become a verified Developer, which comes with special benefits.

# Benefits

## Developer
The developer of a bot receives a "Verified Bot Developer" <img src="/uploads/badges/verified_developer_badge.png" alt="Verified Developer Badge" width="21" height="21"/> badge, which is shown on their account alongside all other badges they may have.
