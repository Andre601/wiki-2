Discord Bot Developers, which own a bot that is in more than 75 simultanious servers, can apply to become a verified Developer, which comes with special benefits.

# Benefits

## Developer
The developer of a bot receives a "Verified Bot Developer" <img src="/uploads/badges/verified_developer_badge.png" alt="Verified Developer Badge" width="21" height="21"/> badge, which is shown on their account alongside all other badges they may have.

## Bots
All verified bots will receive a checkmark within the "BOT" tag right next to their name, the ability to pass 100 simultanious servers limit and, if requested, the access to Privileged Gateway Intents.

> After October 7th, all unverified bots will not be able to join more than 100 simultanious servers and all bots, if not requested, will lose the access to Privileged Gateway Intents.

# Verification
Once you're eligible to verify your bot, you will receive an e-mail from Discord and an official Direct Message from Discord too inside the app (the user will have "System" tag near its username).

The message will also have a link to your application in Discord Developers Portal, where you will be able to start the verification process. While visiting your application's page, a warning sign will be visible near "Bot" tab's name and inside that tab a warning will be visible, encouraging you to verify.

After clicking "Get Started" button, you'll need to provide the required data. After submitting the form, you'll need to wait for response from Discord - they might ask you to provide additional data if required, so keep an eye out on your e-mail inbox! Once you get verified, you'll receive a confirmation about this.
