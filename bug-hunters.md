# Bug Hunters
Bug Hunters are an elite group of Discord users, who have successfully found bugs with Discord on any client and had it reproduced by three users. They help the Discord developers to learn about bugs and fix them.

Every day, they get on Discord and continue to search and verify other bugs that other users have reported. They use [Discord Canary](/canary), and work hard every day to help new users find bugs, check if they're a duplicate of already reported bugs, and sometimes help others format their report.

## Become a Bug Hunter!
To become a Bug Hunter, there are a couple steps.

* Join Discord Testers
* Find a Bug
* Check if it's been reported before
* Format it
* Submit it
* Get it approved!

### Joining Discord Testers
First you have to join the Discord Testers server. If you're already in the server, great! If not, [here](http://discord.gg/discord-testers)'s an invite link!

### Submitting the report
Once you've joined the server, head over to the #report-a-bug channel and follow all of the instructions to properly submit a bug. 

### What do I get?
* Bug Hunter General - Once you get a bug approved, you gain access to the ultra-prestigious Bug Hunter General channel. The Bug Hunters use the channel to discuss pretty much anything, and sometimes joke around and go on wild goose chases for numbers in playing statuses.
* Bug Hunter Bug Chat - Where bugs in the queue and potential bugs are discussed.
* Approve or Deny Reports - Once you're a certified Bug Hunter, you can help approve or deny bugs that are in the queue.
* [Bug Hunter Badge](https://discordia.me/badges#discord-bug-hunter) - The top Bug Hunters can earn a special badge on their profile signifying that they are a certified Bug Hunter.

## Tips and Tricks
The best way to find bugs is to use Discord normally, and not go out of your way to find bugs, one will come to you. 
* Use Discord Canary to get new features more often and test them. 
* Don't get discouraged when a bug that you reported gets denied. It happens to all of us, just keep going. Read the denial reason and it'll be fine!
