# Style Guide [WIP]
The Style Guide is for maintaining consistency across the Discord Wik. More in-depth sections of the guide are below. Due to the different writing styles that editors of the Discord Wiki have, 100% consistency across every artice will be impossible. The following rules should be taken into consideration when writing any article, however any questions with formatting not answered in this guide should be brought up in the Discord server. 

# General Title Rules
* Any title should be relatively short and able to be read in under ten seconds. 
* Title Case should always be used, unless it is stylized that way by Discord, or looks more natural.
* The first letter of the title should always be capitalized, unless it is stylized that way by Discord. 
> HypeSquad
{.is-success}
> hypeSquad
{.is-danger}
* An, A, or The should not be used as the first word, unless it is stylized that way by Discord.
> Channel Permissions
{.is-success}
> The Channel Permissions
{.is-danger}
* Punctuation should not be used, unless stylized that way by Discord.

> Discord Nitro.
