# Style Guide
The Style Guide is for maintaining consistency across The Discord Wiki. More in-depth sections of the guide are below. Due to the different writing styles that editors of The Discord Wiki have, 100% consistency across every article will be impossible. The following rules should be taken into consideration when writing any article, however any questions with formatting not answered in this guide should be brought up in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/a4S5uVB). 

# General Rules
* The main style should be informative, unnecessary jokes should not be added.
* Images should be directly uploaded using the 'file upload' feature of Wiki.js instead of using imgur or other file upload services.
* Titles must be provided. Subtitles are optional but helpful.
* Articles should not be made on general, information lacking subjects such as specific permissions, or unreleased features.
* Sources should always come from Discord, and not third-party leaks.
* The Discord Wiki should always be formatted as `The Discord Wiki`, with The capitalized.
* Brand names that are stylized as a link (such as Battle.​net) should have a zero-width space inserted to break the link.

# Title Rules
* Any title should be relatively short and able to be read in under ten seconds. 
* Title case should always be used, unless it is stylized that way by Discord, or looks more natural.
* The first letter of the title should always be capitalized, unless it is stylized that way by Discord.

## Section Title Rules
* Main title rules should always be considered in naming sections.
* Section titles should not refer to the subject of the article.
> Correct | Features

# Translation Rules

* Translated articles should always be assigned to their proper locale, located as a 'globe' icon at the top right.
* Discord, Nitro, and other branded words should not be translated.
* Regional currency conversions (such as the British pound, and EU euro) should be listed with the main USD price.

## English Variation Rules

* If different spellings of words exist, the most common variation should be used.
