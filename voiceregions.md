Voice Regions allow you to have high quality calls with your friends. The closer a user is to a voice region, the better the call quality will be. To change a voice region in a group call or private call, click the icon on the top right of the screen labeled 'region' and select your desired region from the dropdown menu. The closest region to the user who started the call will be the default region.
