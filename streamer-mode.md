Discord has a Streamer Mode that allows you to access Discord during a stream without risk of revealing personal information.

# Activating Streamer Mode
To use Streamer Mode, click the cog on the bottom left of the Discord application to access the [User Settings](/user-settings) and click on 'Streamer Mode'.

From this tab you may enable or disable Streamer Mode or let Discord automatically toggle it on and off if it detects OBS or XSplit running on your computer.

By default Discord hides emails, notes, connected accounts, invite links and discriminators and disables sounds and notifications when Streamer Mode is enabled. If you don't want to hide or disable all of these, you may toggle the settings from the Streamer Mode menu.
