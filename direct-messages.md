<!-- SUBTITLE: Directly sending Users messages outside of Servers -->

Direct Messages (in short DMs) are a minimalist version of Discord guilds between multiple users. They don't have a permission system, and they only have one text channel. Users can only be invited directly by friends, unlike guilds where this has to be done using an instant invite link.

# Regular Direct Messages
* Between exactly 2 users
* No permissions
* External emotes allowed
* No need to be friends (depending on settings)
* Must share a server (depending on settings)
# Group Messages
* Between at least 3 users
* No permissions
* Users may only add their friends
* Bots can't be added

In the future, some features like Video Calling and Screensharing will be brought to Direct Messages.
