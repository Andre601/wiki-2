<!-- SUBTITLE: Directly sending Users messages outside of Servers -->

Direct Messages (in short DMs) are a minimalist version of Discord guilds between multiple users. They don't have a permission system, and they only have one text channel. Users can only be invited directly by friends, unlike Guilds where this has to be done using an invite link.

# Regular Direct Messages
* Between exactly 2 users
* No Permission System
* Allowing external emotes
* No need to be friended (depending on settings)
* Must share a server (depending on settings)
# Group Messages
* Between at least 3 users
* No Permission system
* Allowing all paricipants to manage messages
* To add new users the adding user needs to be a friend of the addded users
* Bots can't be added

In the future, some features like Video Calling and Screensharing will be brought to Direct Messages.
