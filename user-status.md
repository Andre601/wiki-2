# Status options
Below is a list of the statuses you can select and a description to them.

## Online
Online mode is the default status. You normally receive notifications, can use Discord and show up in the member list normally. You also will have a green circle on your profile picture.

## Away
The Away status also lets you use all features though just shows to others that you're away. Notifications come up normally, you can use Discord normally. 
The away status also automatically is set by the client if there wasn't any mouse movement or typing for a set amount of time while you're set as online. When there's mouse movement within the window again you get put back into online status. The status circle on your profile will be yellow.

Do Not Disturb (short DND) disables all desktop and push notifications, even from mentions. The status color will be red.

## Invisible
Invisible lets you use Discord normally though you won't show up in the member list of servers larger than 50 members and with offline users in servers with less than 50 members, exactly as if you were offline. Typing indicators still show.

## Offline
This status is applied to your account as soon as every connected client loses connection. It can't be applied manually.
