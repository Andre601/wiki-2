*This article is about Discord's User statuses. If you are looking for Discord's server status, go [here](https://status.discordapp.com) instead.*

The user status in Discord consists of four settings to serve as quickly changeable notification settings. It was inspired by the status option in many other chat and VoIP programs. The status can be changed by clicking on your profile picture in the left drawer in the desktop or mobile app.

# Statuses

## Online
Online mode is the default status. You receive notifications, can use Discord and show up in the member list normally. You also will have a green circle on your profile picture.

## Away <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/459151263137923072.png?v=1" width="12" height="12">
The Away status performs the same way as the Online status. Notifications come up normally, and you can use Discord normally. 
The Away status is also set automatically if there was no mouse movement or typing for a set amount of time while set as online. When there's mouse movement within the window again, you get put back into online status unless Away status was set manually. Away displays as a yellow status indicator on your profile. 



## Do Not Disturb <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/459151262924144660.png?v=1" width="12" height="12">
Do Not Disturb (also known as DND) disables all desktop and push notifications, even from mentions. Do Not Disturb displays as a red status indicator on your profile. 

### Streaming <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/459201345455652895.png?v=1" width="12" height="12">

The Streaming status can only be set when streaming on an account integrated with your Discord account. It performs the same way as Do Not Disturb and displays as a purple status indicator on your profile. 

## Invisible <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/459151263179735050.png?v=1" width="12" height="12">
Invisible lets you use Discord normally while appearing offline, however the typing indicator will still be displayed when typing. Invisible and offline statuses display as a gray status indicator on your profile. 

## Offline
This status is applied to your account as soon as every connected client loses connection. It can't be applied manually.
