<!-- TITLE:Discord Stable -->

Discord Stable is the main Discord client. 
The main client is called Stable because it has very little bugs.
All features released on stable have been tested for bugs by users on [Canary](https://discordia.me/canary) and/or the [Public Test Build](https://discordia.me/ptb).
