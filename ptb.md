<!-- TITLE:Discord Public Test Build -->

The Public Test Build is the beta version of the Discord Client and the middle ground between the Stable and Canary clients. The Public Test Build (PTB) sometimes has features that are not available on [Stable](/stable). The PTB is intended to be a way for users to help Discord test new features, so it can be expected that PTB is less stable than the main client. PTB tends to receive features later than the [Canary](/canary) build.

The PTB build has the same icon as the Stable build.
