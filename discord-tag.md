## Changing your Discord Tag
Changing Discord tag is possible by having a [Discord Nitro](/nitro) subscription, or being a [Discord Partner](/partner). This allows one to set your Discord tag to any number between 0001 and 9999, provided it isn't already taken, and is limited to 5 changes per hour. If a user's Nitro subscription expires, their Discord tag will be randomly reset to a different number, but only if the advantage of the perk is taken.
