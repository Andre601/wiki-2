# Discord Tags
A "Discord tag", or sometimes referred to as a "discriminator", is the number displayed next to someone's username on Discord. Discord tags are how Discord differentiates between users with the same username.

Discord tags range from 0001 to 9999 and are randomly assigned. Two users with the same username may not have the same Discord tag and if you change your username to something where a user with that name already has your Discord-tag, your Discord-tag will automatically change itself.

 > NOTE: You cannot create a username for which all Discord-tag spots have been taken. If you attempt to change to a username for which all Discord-tag slots are taken, Discord will return an error.

## Changing your Discord Tag
Changing your Discord tag is possible by having a [Discord Nitro](/nitro) subscription, or being a [Discord Partner](/partner). This allows you to set your Discord tag to any number between 0001 and 9999, provided it isn't already taken. You are limited to 5 changes per hour. If your Nitro subscription expires, your Discord tag will be randomly reset to a different number, but only if you took advantage of the perk.

Changing your Discord tag without Nitro is possible once every 24 hours. However, Discord has stated that it is prohibited to "Discord tag/discriminator farm", or using a bot to automatically change your name to a matching username and Discord tag to change your own. Manually changing your username to change the Discord tag is also frowned upon, but is technically permitted and heavily ratelimited.
