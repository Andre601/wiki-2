# Discord Tags
A "Discord tag" is the combination of a username and their discriminator (a 4-digit number). The tag always appears as `username#discriminator`.

## Discriminator
The discriminator is used by Discord to distinguish multiple users that share the same name.
Each user gets a random discriminator assigned that can range from 0001 up to 9999. The number 0000 is only used by webhooks and [Clyde](/clyde) respectively.

When all discriminators for a specific username are taken can no new account with the same name be created.

## Changing your Discriminator
Changing your Discriminator is possible by having a [Discord Nitro / Discord Nitro Classic](/nitro) subscription, or being a [Discord Partner](/partner). This allows one to set your Discord tag to any number between 0001 and 9999, provided it isn't already taken, and is limited to 5 changes per hour. If a user's Nitro subscription expires, their Discriminator will be randomly reset to a different number, but only if the advantage of the perk is taken.
