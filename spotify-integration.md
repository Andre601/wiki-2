# Spotify Integration
## Adding the Integration

A Spotify account can be added to your profile through the Connections tab in User Settings.

Upon clicking the Spotify logo, you will be directed to a login page to enter your Spotify username and password. Once this is done, your Spotify account will appear in the Connections tab. 
Below the profile, options will include:
* Display on profile (displays Spotify username on user profile)
* Display Spotify as your status (displays Spotify now-playing in status, and profiles)

## Listening Along
Users that have Spotify Premium can listen along with other users.
