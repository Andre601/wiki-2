A server (occasionally referred to as a *guild* in Discord documentation) is the main feature on Discord.

*A server with one text channel and two voice channels.*

# Joining a Server
Users can join servers by going to the invite link in their browser or by scrolling down to the bottom of their server list, clicking the + icon, and entering the invite code.
## Creating a Server
Users can create a server by scrolling to the bottom of their server list and clicking the + icon.

# Features
Servers may contain text channels, voice channels, roles and custom emojis.
## Text Channels
Text channels are how users communicate with each other on a server. Users with the "Manage Channels" permission may create and delete text and voice channels. These extra text channels may edited so that only certain roles and/or users may read it. As of a new update, the first channel created will not be the default text channel. The default channel now changes to the one with the lowest permissions. 
## Voice Channels
Voice channels allow server members to talk to each other using their voices. There is no default voice channels and all permissions may be edited for any voice channel. Servers are not required to have voice channels, but they make the party a bit more fun!
## Roles
Servers contain [roles](/roles) which - when assigned - give users certain permissions and a custom name-color (if set). Servers typically use roles to assign special permissions or signify a rank on an external website.

## Custom Emoji
Each server is allowed to upload 50 custom [emoji](/emoji), which can be used by any member (with the permission) on the server. If a user has Nitro, they may use the server's custom emoji on any other server or private message that allows it. To upload custom emoji (if you have the 'Manage Emojis' permission) go to Server Settings and click the Emoji button. Once there, you will be promoted you may upload emoji and rename them. You may also delete emoji from this page.
# Verification Levels
Server administrators may toggle the verification level. When a verification level is set, members must meet the criteria before they can create a direct message with someone in the server or send messages in a text channel. If a member is assigned a role, they will bypass the verification.

Levels:
* None
* Low - Must have verified the email address tied to their Discord account.
* Medium - In addition to the "Low" verification level, the user must also be registered on Discord for longer than 5 minutes.
* (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ - In addition to the above verification levels, the user must also be in the server for 10 minutes.
* ┻━┻ ﾐヽ(ಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻ - The user must have a verified phone number tied to their Discord account.

# Vanity Invites
Some servers have the ability to be able to set custom invite links, instead of a randomly generated one. One example is https://discord.gg/discord-developers. Servers gain the ability to set vanity invites if they are a [Discord Partner](/partner), [Verified Server](/verified-servers), or owned by a Discord Developer. Any member with Manage Server can customize the vanity invite.
